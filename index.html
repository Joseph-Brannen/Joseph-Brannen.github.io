                <h2>about me</h2>
                <p>Hi there, I'm Joe. In late 2021, my former boss asked for my help to create an internal CRM and revenue tracking system for our sales team. As I was creating these systems something struck me &#8213; I had never had so much fun in my professional career than I had experienced working on these projects. Although I didn't know it immediatley, my journey into a career change was born.</p>
                <p>As 2022 was drawing to a close I began seeking help from a career coach, and utilizing career assessment tests that kept pointing me to a career in software development. Fortunately, I have many friends who are in this space and I began asking their advice. In August of 2023, after months of seeking professional advice, I chose to pause my sales career in order to pursue learning front-end development full time.</p>   
                <p>Back then, the most basic HTML code confused me, but I enjoyed the challenge, learning, and problem-solving. Thankfully, with the support of my wife, professional mentors, friends, and family I have gone from being a true novice in software development to being prepared to begin my career in this space. Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope to hear from you.</p>
